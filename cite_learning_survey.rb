puts "\nDefinitions and Teaching Techniques for Major Learning Styles"
puts "\nVisual-Language:\nLearning Style: This is the student who learns well from seeing words in books, on the chalkboard, charts or workbooks. He/she may write words down that are given orally in order to learn by seeing them on paper. He or she remembers and uses information better if it has been read. \nTeaching Technique: This student will benefit from a variety of books, pamphlets and written materials on several levels of difficulty. Given some time alone with a book, he or she may learn more than in class. Make sure important information has been given on paper, or that he or she takes notes if you want this student to remember specific information."
puts "\nVisual-Numerical:\nLearning Style: This student has to see numbers on the board, in a book, or on paper in order to work with them. He or she is more likely to remember and understand math facts if he or she has seen them. He or she does not seem to need as much oral explanation.\nTeaching Technique: This student will benefit from worksheets, workbooks, and texts. Give a variety of written materials and allow time to study it. In playing games and being involved in activities with numbers and number problems, make sure they are visible, printed numbers, not oral games and activities. Important data should be given on paper."
puts "\nAuditory-Language:\nLearning Style: This is the student who learns from hearing words spoken. You may hear him or her vocalizing or see the lips or throat move as he or she reads, particularly when striving to understand new material. He or she will be more capable of understanding and remembering words or facts that have been learned by hearing.\nTeaching Technique: This student will benefit from hearing audio tapes, rote oral practice, lecture or a class discussion. He or she may benefit from using a tape recorder to make tapes to listen to later, by teaching another student, or conversing with the teacher. Groups of two or more, games or interaction activities provide the sounds of words being spoken that is so important to this student."
puts "\nAuditory-Numerical:\nLearning Style: This student learns from hearing numbers and oral explanations. He or she may remember phone and locker numbers with ease, and be successful with oral numbers, games and puzzles. He or she may do just about as well without a math book, for written materials are not as important. He or she can probably work problems in his or her head. You may hear this student saying the numbers aloud or see the lips move as a problem is read.\nTeaching Technique: This student will benefit from math sound tapes or from working with other people, talking about a problem. Even reading written explanations aloud will help. Games or activities in which the number problems are spoken will help. This student will benefit from tutoring another or delivering an explanation to his or her study group or to the teacher. Make sure important facts are spoken."
puts "\nAuditory-Visual-Kinesthetic:\nLearning Style: The A/V/K student learns best by experience and self-involvement. He or she definitely needs a combination of stimuli. The manipulation of material along with the accompanying sights and sounds (words and numbers seen and spoken) will make a big difference to him or her. This student may not seem able to understand, or keep his or her mind on work unless he or she is totally involved. He or she seeks to handle, touch and work with what is being learned. Sometimes just writing or a symbolic wriggling of the fingers is a symptom of the A/V/K learner.\nTeaching Technique: This student must be given more than just a reading or math assignment. Involve him or her with at least one other student and give him or her an activity to relate to the assignment. Accompany an audio- tape with pictures, objects and an activity such as drawing or writing or following directions with physical involvement."
puts "\nSocial-Individual:\nLearning Style: This student gets more work done alone. He or she thinks best, and remembers more when he or she has learned by alone. He or she cares more for his or her own opinions than for the ideas of others. You will not have much trouble keeping this student from over-socializing during class.\nTeaching Technique: This student needs to be allowed to do important learning alone. If you feel he or she needs socialization, save it for a non- learning situation. Let him or her go to the library or back in a corner of the room to be alone. Do not force group work on him or her when it will make the student irritable to be held back or distracted by others. Some great thinkers are loners."
puts "\nSocial-Group:\nLearning Style: This student strives to study with at least one other student and he or she will not get as much done alone. He or she values othersâ€™ ideas and preferences. Group interaction increases his or her learning and later recognition of facts. Socializing is important to this student. \nTeaching Technique: This student needs to do important learning with someone else. The stimulation of the group may be more important at certain times in the learning process than at others and you may be able to facilitate the timing for this student."
puts "\nExpressive Oral:\nLearning Style: This student prefers to tell what he or she knows. He or she talks fluently, comfortably, and clearly. The teacher may find that this learner knows more than written tests show. He or she is probably less shy than others about giving reports or talking to the teacher or classmates. The muscular coordination involved in writing may be difficult for this learner. Organizing and putting thoughts on paper may be too slow and tedious a task for this student. \nTeaching Technique: Allow this student to make oral reports instead of written ones. Whether in conference, small group or large, evaluate him or her more by what is said than by what is written. Reports can be on tape, to save class time. Demand a minimum of written work, but a good quality so he or she will not be ignorant of the basics of composition and legibility. Grammar can be corrected orally but is best done at another time."
puts "\nExpressiveness-Written:\nLearning Style: This student can write fluent essays and good answers on tests to show what he or she knows. He or she feels less comfortable, perhaps even stupid when oral answers are required. His or her thoughts are better organized on paper than when they are given orally.\nTeaching Technique: This student needs to be allowed to write reports, keep notebooks and journals for credit and take written tests for evaluation. Oral transactions should be under non- pressured conditions, perhaps even in a one-to-one conference."
